* As opposed to the Options being stacked on top of eachother in 4 columns they are stacked 2X2 on any device where the screen is over 900px - Medium to Large Tablets, Laptops and Desktops.
* This aims to make the Quiz neat, simple and compact.

## Final Scores Section

* Once the last question has been answered, a "drop-down" appears with your final score and the options to view the answers or restart the quiz
